## Introduction  
The Advertising dataset contains data on sales (in thousands of units) for a particular product as a function of advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for TV, radio, and newspaper media. The goal is to suggest, on the basis of this data, a marketing plan for next year that will results in high product sales. In this report, we will focus specifcally on the TV budget and its relationship with sales. Some questions we would like to explore include:      
1. What are the average TV ads budget and average sales in this dataset?  
2. Is there a relationship between TV ads budget and sales?  
3. How strong is the relationship?  
4. Is the relationship linear?
